# Sliding Tile Puzzle
##Problem: The Sliding Eight 
A 3 × 3 grid is filled with eight tiles, numbered 1 through 8, and one empty space. Initially, the grid is in a jumbled configuration. A tile can be slid into an adjacent empty space, leaving the tile’s previous location empty. The goal is to slide the tiles to place the grid in an ordered configuration, from tile 1 in the upper left.
