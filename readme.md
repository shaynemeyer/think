# Think Like a Programmer

## Strategies for Problem Solving
Problems include constraints, unbreakable rules about the problem or the way in which the problem must be solved.

When solving a problem with a program, you also have constraints. Common constraints include the programming language, platform (does it run on a PC, or an iPhone, or what?), performance (a game program may require graphics to be updated at least 30 times a second, a business application might have a maximum time response to user input), or memory footprint. Sometimes the constraint involves what other code you can reference: Maybe the program can’t include certain open-source code, or maybe the opposite — maybe it can use only open source.

For programmers, then, we can define problem solving as writing an original program that performs a particular set of tasks and meets all stated constraints.
